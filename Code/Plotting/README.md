This folder contains scripts for plotting the solution, after the solution structure `sol` is loaded from an output .mat file using a command such as:

`load('Data/simulation.mat');`

For example:
- plot_sections.m can be used to plot a J-V curve
- plot_recombination.m plots the rates of different types of bulk recombination
