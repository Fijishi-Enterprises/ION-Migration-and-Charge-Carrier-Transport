This folder is for developers. The tests are written in the style of Matlab's built-in testing framework. To run the tests, use the following commands:

```
reset_path;
runtests('Code\Tests\test_IonMonger.m');
```

- test_IonMonger.m contains a set of tests which can be used to check the consistency of future updates
- the Data folder contains a file called simulation_1.0.mat which is an example output generated by the first version of the code (v1.0)
